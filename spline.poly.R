#   The rows of 'xy' give coordinates of the boundary vertices, in order.
#   'vertices' is the number of spline vertices to create.
#              (Not all are used: some are clipped from the ends.)
#   'k' is the number of points to wrap around the ends to obtain
#       a smooth periodic spline.
#
#   Returns an array of points. 
# 
spline.poly <- function(xy, vertices, k=3, ...) {
    # Assert: xy is an n by 2 matrix with n >= k.
    
    # Wrap k vertices around each end.
    n <- dim(xy)[1]
    if (k >= 1) {
        data <- rbind(xy[(n-k+1):n,], xy, xy[1:k, ])
    } else {
        data <- xy
    }
    
    # Spline the x and y coordinates.
    data.spline <- spline(1:(n+2*k), data[,1], n=vertices, ...)
    x <- data.spline$x
    x1 <- data.spline$y
    x2 <- spline(1:(n+2*k), data[,2], n=vertices, ...)$y
    
    # Retain only the middle part.
    cbind(x1, x2)[k < x & x <= n+k, ]
